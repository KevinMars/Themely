Final Project at Metis


Text Analysis of a rapper's album using RapGenius.com

Used a scraper to get the lyrics and annotations from Nas' albums spanning a 15 year music career. Filtered the data and found distinguishing keywords of each album using TFIDF vectorizer (LDA didn't work well for rap songs). Grouped shared keywords under a topic, and looked at topic usage over time. 

- I was able to get a sense of Nas' growth as a musician and person through his lyrics. 
- Uses of this topic system can include song recommendations based on lyrics, topics, and historical references.
